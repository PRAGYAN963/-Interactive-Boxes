# Interactive Expanding Boxes

This project is a modern, interactive UI component for product selection, inspired by e-commerce bundle offers. Users can select between different product bundles (1, 2, or 3 units), each with its own discount, price, and options for size and color. The design is visually appealing, responsive, and easy to use.

## Features
- **Expanding/Collapsing Boxes:** Click any box to expand and view detailed options. Only one box can be expanded at a time.
- **Dynamic Offer Display:** Each box shows a summary (collapsed) and detailed options (expanded), with custom badges, prices, and radio selection.
- **Pink Radio Buttons:** Custom-styled radio buttons for selection.
- **Most Popular Ribbon:** The middle box features a "MOST POPULAR" ribbon for emphasis.
- **Live Total Update:** The total price updates based on the selected box.
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on desktop and mobile.
